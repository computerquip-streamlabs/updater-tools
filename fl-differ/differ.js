/**
 * This compares a file list with another file list in order

 * matters! For example, asking how the letter A is different
 * from the letter B would result in a different response than
 * if you asked how the letter B was different from the letter A.
 *
 * In this case, the second parameter you specify will act as
 * the file list you want to move to. Essentially, it's making
 * a patch that goes from the first parameter to the second
 * parameter.
